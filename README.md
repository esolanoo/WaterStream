# WaterStream
Through a PID controller in an ATMEGA16A and the help of some thermocouples and hidraulic motors we control the flow rate and temperature of the mixture of a jar of cold water and one with hot water.

In this project, we started with two containers previously prepared with cold water (with ice) and hot water close to boiling. These in turn, are joined and regulated through the use of a hydraulic pump. At this junction, water must flow out at the temperature requested by the user, programmed with a matrix keyboard. This project is done with ultrasonic sensors and is controlled with a PID system in C using a microcontroller ATMEGA16A.

This proyect was made in collaboration with my uni colleagues.
